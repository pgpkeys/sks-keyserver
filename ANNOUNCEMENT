We are pleased to announce the availability of a new stable SKS
release:  Version 1.1.5.

SKS is an OpenPGP keyserver whose goal is to provide easy to deploy,
decentralized, and highly reliable synchronization. That means that a
key submitted to one SKS server will quickly be distributed to all key
servers, and even wildly out-of-date servers, or servers that experience
spotty connectivity, can fully synchronize with rest of the system.

What's New in 1.1.5
====================
[XXXXXX]

Note when upgrading from earlier versions of SKS
====================
The default values for pagesize settings changed in SKS 1.1.4. To continue
using an existing DB without rebuilding, explicit settings have to be
added to the sksconf file.
pagesize:       4
ptree_pagesize: 1

Getting the Software
====================
SKS can be downloaded from 
https://bitbucket.org/skskeyserver/sks-keyserver

Prerequisites
====================
There are a few prerequisites to building this code. You need:
* ocaml-3.11.0 or later (ocaml-3.12.x is recommended). Get it from 
  <http://www.ocaml.org>
* Berkeley DB version 4.6.* or later, whereby 4.8 or later is recommended.  
  You can find the appropriate versions at
  <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/berkeleydb/downloads/index.html>
* GNU Make and a C compiler (e.g gcc)


Verifying the integrity of the download
====================
Releases of SKS are signed using the SKS Keyserver Signing Key
available on public keyservers with the KeyID

    0x41259773973A612A
	
and has a fingerprint of

    C90E F143 0B3A C0DF D00E 6EA5 4125 9773 973A 612A.
	
Using GnuPG, verification can be accomplished by, first, retrieving the signing key using

    gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 0x41259773973A612A
	
followed by verifying that you have the correct key

    gpg --keyid-format long --fingerprint 0x41259773973A612A

should produce:

    pub   4096R/41259773973A612A 2012-06-27
    Key fingerprint = C90E F143 0B3A C0DF D00E 6EA5 4125 9773 973A 612A
		
A check should also be made that the key is signed by
trustworthy other keys;

    gpg --list-sigs 0x41259773973A612A

and the fingerprint should be verified through other trustworthy sources.
			
Once you are certain that you have the correct key downloaded, you can create
a local signature, in order to remember that you have verified the key.

     gpg --lsign-key 0x41259773973A612A

Finally; verifying the downloaded file can be done using

    gpg --keyid-format long --verify sks-x.y.z.tgz.asc

The resulting output should be similar to
	
    gpg: Signature made Wed Jun 27 12:52:39 2012 CEST
    gpg:                using RSA key 41259773973A612A
    gpg: Good signature from "SKS Keyserver Signing Key"
